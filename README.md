# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

I'm Artem, a React developer with a passion for leveraging modern technologies to create compelling web applications.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

Here's a glimpse of the technologies I work with:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Backend**: Express, Pug

I enjoy crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript. React and Redux are my go-to tools for building dynamic and maintainable web applications.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus

I'm currently immersed in honing my skills in React and Redux to create even more efficient and user-centric applications. Alongside that, I keep my eye on emerging technologies and tools to keep my skillset up-to-date.

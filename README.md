## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

I'm Artem, an enthusiastic Junior React Developer with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for solving problems. I have a knack for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. 

I have experience in building web applications using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, React, Redux, and more. I've also worked with backend technologies including Express and MongoDB. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.

Previously, I've worked on a messenger server application using technologies like JS, Express, Pug, MongoDB + Mongoose, 0Auth, SSE, and REST API. 

I'm currently focusing on mastering my React and Redux skills and exploring new technologies and tools to broaden my skillset.

## Main technologies
| HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Redux | Jest | MongoDB |
